## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Chart.js Integration**
```javascript
// Responsive chart configuration
options: {
    responsive: true,
    maintainAspectRatio: false,
    animation: {
        duration: 1000,
        easing: 'easeInOutQuart'
    }
}
```

### **CSS Animations**
```css
@keyframes growBar {
    from { height: 0; }
    to { height: var(--height); }
}

.css-bar {
    animation: growBar 2s ease-out forwards;
}
```

### **D3.js Physics Simulation**
```javascript
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(data.nodes)
    .force('link', d3.forceLink(data.links).id(d => d.id))
    .force('charge', d3.forceManyBody().strength(-100))
    .force('center', d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2));
```

### **React-like Component System**
```javascript
class ChartComponent {
    constructor(canvasId, options = {}) {
        this.state = { ...options };
        this.listeners = new Map();
        this.init();
    }
    
    setState(newState) {
        this.state = { ...this.state, ...newState };
        this.update();
        this.notifyListeners('stateChange', this.state);
    }
}
```
